# edit-distance-and-longest-subsequence
Shows the min edits you need to change one string into another and the longest similar subsequence between two strings (CS 325 2021) <br />
please compile with c++ 11 g++ -std=c++11 your_file.cpp -o your_program <br />
When running, please give two text files with strings in the command line, ie. ./run text1.txt text2.txt <br />
The program will automatically get rid of any charaters other than the alphabet. <br />
This program uses tabulation to find the min edits needed to change one string to another, and the longest similar subsequence between two string <br />
The two files given are the original coivd genome and the delta variant, to show its simularity <br />
 
<br />
the output is as followed: (edit distance) (similar subsequence length)
